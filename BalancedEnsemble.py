    Class that will fit a LogisticRegression model to several splits of the dataset.
    Each split is made of a different subset (non-overlapping) of the majority 
    class instances plus all minority class instances, such that both are roughly
    the same size at each split.
    
    Implements the fit() and predict() methods "Ã  la" scikit-learn so that it can
    be used as a model from that library.
