# Imbalanced training

Small training on different methods to combat imbalanced datasets:

- Under/Over-Sampling
- SMOTE
- Tomek Links
- Ensemble scheme on balanced splits of the original dataset.

Inspired by this [KDNuggets article](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/06/7-techniques-handle-imbalanced-data.html).
